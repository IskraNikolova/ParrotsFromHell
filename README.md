# Parrots From Hell NFT Collection
Welcome to the "Parrots From Hell" NFT collection, a unique and collectible set of digital art pieces built on the Avalanche network. Each NFT in this collection represents a unique parrot with its own personality and story.

## Contracts
The "Parrots From Hell" NFT collection is powered by three smart contracts on the Avalanche network. The first contract is for tickets, which are limited in number and provide the opportunity for ticket holders to be the first to mine five NFTs from each of the two collections for free. This increases the chance of getting a legendary NFT and secures the ticket holder's rights to the mined NFT, including any potential royalty rights based on rarity.

The other two contracts handle the creation and transfer of NFTs, ensuring their authenticity and scarcity.

## Gift NFTs
As a special bonus, everyone who owns an NFT from the first collection will receive a free NFT from the second collection as a gift. This is a great way to increase the value of your collection and add more unique and collectible pieces to your portfolio.

## Minting Page
The "Parrots From Hell" NFT collection has a minting page where new NFTs can be created and added to the collection. This page allows artists to submit their artwork and create NFTs that can be bought and sold.

## Getting Started
To get started with the "Parrots From Hell" NFT collection, you will need to set up a wallet that is compatible with the Avalanche network. From there, you can explore the minting page and purchase NFTs from the collection.

## Conclusion
The "Parrots From Hell" NFT collection is a unique and exciting project that combines digital art with blockchain technology.
